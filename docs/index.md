## Getting Started with Gap Analysis
Supergreen is a systematic approach for gap analysis of ML models trained on tabular data.
It helps you identify the features that are contributing to the model prediction errors.

<!-- - Fetch business relevant data (coming soon)-->
- Follow [feature engineering](feature_engineering.md) guidelines. 
- Find [weak segments](weak_segments.md) (combination of features) 
  in which the model is struggeling.
- [Label each segment](label_segments.md) with the root cause.        

For advanced features check out the [python api reference](api.md) 
<!-- - Trace the problem back to the trainset or drift (coming soon) -->
